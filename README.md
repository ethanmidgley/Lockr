# Lockr

Lockr is an encryption/decryption client for files and folder. It has been designed with symetric encryption and therefore both parties must share the same password

The ciper used is a 256 bit AES stream cipher. This keeps security whilst allowing the encryption of larger files as it does not need to load it all in to memory
